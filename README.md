# Business Process Optimization: Order Fulfillment

## Overview
This Python script applies Lean Six Sigma principles to optimize an order fulfillment process, simulating current and optimized workflows for 50 orders to quantify improvements in time, cost, and environmental impact. It identifies inefficiencies, implements automation, and provides advanced analytics like bottleneck detection and risk assessment, outputting results to a CSV file for Power BI reporting. Designed for scalability and clarity, it showcases process engineering and data analysis skills for professional evaluation.

## Features
- **Process Mapping**: Models order fulfillment (receive, verify inventory, process payment, pick, pack, label, ship) with realistic, skewed time distributions.
- **Simulation Realism**: Uses skewed normal distributions (`skewnorm`) for step times to mimic real-world variability.
- **Bottleneck Analysis**: Identifies critical steps via utilization metrics and visualizes correlations with a heatmap.
- **Cost Modeling**: Includes labor ($0.50/min), error ($10/error), and opportunity costs (nonlinear delay impact).
- **Risk Analysis**: Performs Monte Carlo simulations to estimate 95% service level times, visualized as a histogram.
- **Optimization**: Automates inventory checks, parallelizes payment/inventory, optimizes picking routes, reduces errors from 10% to 2%.
- **Sustainability**: Calculates carbon footprint (0.2 kg CO2/min) and reduction benefits.
- **Output**: Generates a Power BI-compatible CSV (`order_fulfillment_metrics.csv`) with 100 rows, downloadable from Google Colab.
- **Visualization**: Produces heatmap and histogram PNGs for bottleneck and risk analysis.
- **Observability**: Includes detailed logging and summary metrics for transparency.

## Prerequisites
- **Environment**: Google Colab (cloud-based Python notebook).
- **Dependencies**: Automatically installed (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`).
- **Internet**: Required for library installation and file downloads.

## Usage
1. Copy and execute the script in a Google Colab notebook.
2. The script will:
   - Simulate current and optimized processes for 50 orders.
   - Analyze bottlenecks and perform Monte Carlo risk assessment.
   - Calculate times, costs, errors, and carbon footprints.
   - Save results to `order_fulfillment_metrics.csv`, downloadable automatically.
   - Generate `bottleneck_analysis.png` and `monte_carlo_risk.png`, also downloadable.
3. Import the CSV into Power BI for visualizations (e.g., time savings, cost reduction).
4. Download `process_optimization.log` for execution details or troubleshooting.

## Process Details
- **Current Process**:
  - Steps: Receive order, verify inventory (manual), process payment (sequential), pick items, pack order, create label (manual), ship order.
  - Inefficiencies: Long inventory checks (7.5 min, right-skewed), payment delays (3.5 min, left-skewed), manual labels (3 min), 10% error rate.
- **Optimized Process**:
  - Improvements: Automated inventory API (0.5 min), parallel payment/inventory, optimized picking (2 min), automated labels (0.5 min), 2% error rate.
  - Approach: Lean (waste elimination), Six Sigma (error reduction).
- **Simulation**: Uses `skewnorm` for time distributions, with costs for labor ($0.50/min), errors ($10/error), and opportunity (delay-based).

## Output
The pipeline produces `order_fulfillment_metrics.csv` with columns:
- `order_id`: Unique identifier (1 to 50).
- `process`: Current or Optimized.
- `time_receive_order`, `time_verify_inventory`, etc.: Step times (minutes).
- `total_time`: Total cycle time.
- `errors`: Number of errors.
- `labor_cost`, `error_cost`, `opp_cost`: Cost components.
- `total_cost`: Sum of all costs.
- `carbon_footprint`: Environmental impact (kg CO2).
- `timestamp`: Simulation timestamp.

Additional outputs:
- `bottleneck_analysis.png`: Heatmap of step time correlations.
- `monte_carlo_risk.png`: Histogram of optimized process times with 95% VaR.

The CSV includes 100 rows (50 current + 50 optimized).

## Technical Details
- **Simulation**: Models steps with skewed normal distributions for realism.
- **Optimization**: Parallelizes inventory/payment using ThreadPoolExecutor; heuristically optimizes picking.
- **Analysis**: Computes bottleneck utilization and Monte Carlo 95% service levels.
- **Cost Model**: Integrates labor, error, and nonlinear opportunity costs.
- **Sustainability**: Quantifies carbon reduction from process improvements.
- **Visualization**: Saves analytical PNGs for easy sharing.
- **Logging**: Captures execution details and summaries (times, costs, errors, carbon).
- **Robustness**: Ensures populated CSV with error checking.

## Customization
To adapt for production:
- **Real Data**: Replace distributions with actual process data (e.g., ERP logs).
- **Steps**: Add steps (e.g., quality checks) in `CURRENT_PROCESS`/`OPTIMIZED_PROCESS`.
- **Costs**: Adjust `LABOR_COST_PER_MIN`, `ERROR_COST`, or opportunity cost formula.
- **Output**: Save to Google Drive or databases (e.g., BigQuery).
- **Scale**: Increase `NUM_ORDERS` for larger simulations.

## Limitations
- **Colab Environment**: Outputs (`order_fulfillment_metrics.csv`, PNGs, log) are temporary and require downloading.
- **Simulation-Based**: Assumes distributions; real data would improve accuracy.
- **Simplifications**: Heuristic picking optimization; no external system integration.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate ERP APIs for real-time data.
- Use advanced routing algorithms (e.g., vehicle routing) for picking.
- Deploy to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS) for continuous monitoring.
- Add machine learning to predict delays from historical patterns.

## Notes
This system demonstrates expertise in Lean Six Sigma, process simulation, cost modeling, and data visualization, tailored for supply chain optimization. Its design emphasizes analytical rigor, scalability, and clarity, making it an excellent showcase for data engineering and process improvement skills.
